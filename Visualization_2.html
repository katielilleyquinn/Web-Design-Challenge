    <h1>Figure 2, City Latitude vs. Humidity</h1>
    <h2> This shows the relationship between city latitude and humidity.</h2>
    <h3> From this graph, we see that there is not a strong correlation between city latitude and humidity. There is a small cluster of outliers with a high latitude that have zero percent humidity. This data was taken from 2017.</h3>
